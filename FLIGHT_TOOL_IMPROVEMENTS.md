# Flight Tool Improvements for Natural Language Queries

## Overview

Enhanced the flight tools to properly handle natural language queries like **"find the cheapest flight this month from israel to budapest"** by improving tool descriptions and letting the AI choose the appropriate tool.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced Tool Descriptions**

Updated tool descriptions to clearly indicate when each tool should be used:

- **`search_flights`**: **ONLY when user provides an exact departure date** (e.g., "June 15th", "2025-06-15", "tomorrow"). **DO NOT use for finding cheapest dates, flexible dates, or "this month" queries.**
- **`get_flight_inspiration`**: For finding cheapest destinations when destination is unknown/flexible. **NOT for finding dates to a specific destination.**
- **`get_cheapest_dates`**: **PRIMARY tool for finding cheap flights when no specific date is given**. PERFECT for queries like "cheapest flight this month from X to Y". ‚úÖ

### 2. **Smart Tool Selection**

Instead of complex fallback logic, we now let the AI choose the right tool based on clear descriptions:

- **Query**: "find the cheapest flight this month from israel to budapest"
- **AI Should Choose**: `get_cheapest_dates` (origin=TLV, destination=BUD)
- **Fallback**: If cheapest dates API fails, provide helpful error with alternatives

### 3. **Automatic Location Resolution**

- **"israel"** ‚Üí **"TLV"** (Tel Aviv)
- **"budapest"** ‚Üí **"BUD"** (Budapest)
- Handles both city names and IATA codes seamlessly

### 4. **Better Error Handling**

When the cheapest dates API fails (500 error), instead of complex fallbacks:

```
‚ùå The cheapest dates search is temporarily unavailable for TLV ‚Üí BUD.

üîÑ Alternative options:
‚Ä¢ Use 'get_flight_inspiration' to see all available destinations from TLV
‚Ä¢ This route may have limited availability in the cheapest dates database
‚Ä¢ The cheapest dates API works best for popular international routes

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Please do NOT use 'search_flights' as it requires specific dates and won't help find the cheapest options across flexible dates.
```

## Why This Approach Works Better

### ‚úÖ **Advantages**

1. **Simpler Logic**: No complex fallback strategies that might confuse results
2. **AI-Driven**: Let the AI choose the right tool based on clear descriptions
3. **User-Friendly**: Clear error messages with actionable alternatives
4. **Efficient**: No unnecessary API calls when the primary API fails
5. **Maintainable**: Easier to debug and modify individual tools

### ‚ùå **Previous Fallback Issues**

1. **Wrong API Usage**: Flight inspiration API is for finding destinations, not dates to specific destinations
2. **Complex Logic**: Multiple date searches were inefficient and didn't match user intent
3. **Confusing Results**: Fallback results looked different from primary API results

## API Mapping

Based on Amadeus SDK analysis:

- **`flightDestinations`** (`/v1/shopping/flight-destinations`) ‚Üí Find cheapest destinations from origin
- **`flightDates`** (`/v1/shopping/flight-dates`) ‚Üí Find cheapest dates between two specific locations
- **`flightOffersSearch`** (`/v1/shopping/flight-offers`) ‚Üí Search specific flights with exact dates

## Test Scenarios

### ‚úÖ **Should Use `get_cheapest_dates`**
- "find the cheapest flight this month from israel to budapest"
- "when is cheapest to fly from TLV to BUD"
- "cheapest dates from New York to Paris"

### ‚úÖ **Should Use `get_flight_inspiration`**
- "where can I fly cheapest from Tel Aviv"
- "show me cheap destinations from NYC"
- "what are the cheapest places to visit from London"

### ‚úÖ **Should Use `search_flights`**
- "find flights from TLV to BUD on June 15th"
- "search flights from israel to budapest on 2025-06-15"
- "book a flight from Tel Aviv to Budapest departing June 15"

## Implementation Status

- ‚úÖ Enhanced tool descriptions
- ‚úÖ Automatic location resolution (israel ‚Üí TLV, budapest ‚Üí BUD)
- ‚úÖ Improved error handling with alternatives
- ‚úÖ Removed complex fallback logic
- ‚úÖ AI-driven tool selection
- ‚úÖ Build and compile successfully
